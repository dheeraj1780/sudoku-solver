# Sudoku Solver

## Project Description

This project is a Python-based Sudoku solver that uses the backtracking algorithm to find solutions for any given Sudoku puzzle. The solver efficiently fills in the puzzle by exploring all possible number placements and backtracking when it encounters conflicts.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Uses a classic algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles by systematically placing numbers and backtracking upon conflicts.
- **User Input**: Accepts Sudoku puzzles in a variety of formats for flexibility.
- **Efficient Solution**: Quickly finds solutions for even the most challenging puzzles.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The Sudoku puzzle is provided as a 9x9 grid, with zeros representing empty cells.
2. **Algorithm**: The backtracking algorithm recursively attempts to place numbers in empty cells, ensuring no conflicts with Sudoku rules.
3. **Output**: The solved Sudoku grid is displayed, showing the completed puzzle.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
